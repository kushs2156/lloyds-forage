1. Which factor is most critical when choosing a machine learning algorithm for predicting customer churn in a data set with a high class imbalance?
   **The availability of techniques to handle class imbalance, such as adjusting class weights or using SMOTE**
2. Why is it important to use techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) in feature selection?
   **To reduce dimensionality and capture underlying patterns that may not be apparent in the original feature space**
3. In the context of an imbalanced data set for churn prediction, why might the ROC-AUC score be preferred over accuracy as a performance metric?
   **Accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced data sets, as it may not reflect the true performance on minority classes**
